# Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot
honeypot on a Raspberry Pi to capture and analyze real-world attack attempts



# Raspberry Pi Honeypot (Work in Progress)

## Overview
This project sets up a honeypot on a Raspberry Pi to capture and analyze real-world attack attempts.  
The goal is to learn about common attacker behavior, brute force attempts, and log analysis.  

## Current Status
- Repo created  
- Research in progress  
- Implementation starting soon  

## Next Steps
- [ ] Install and configure Cowrie honeypot  
- [ ] Forward SSH traffic to the Pi  
- [ ] Collect and store attack logs  
- [ ] Analyze attacker IPs, usernames, and passwords  

## Setup Instructions
(Will include step-by-step guide as I configure the honeypot.)  

```bash
# Example: installing Cowrie dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-venv git -y
